            <h3>What is the app used for?</h3>
            <h5>CSN app is issued by the Swedish National Board of Student Aid for students who are receiving grants/loans</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Check if a payment back from the student is received, and the remaining unpaid amount.</li>
                <li>Check the date when a student gets paid.</li>
                <li>Hand in study insurances.</li>
                <li>Other services that include practice information about students loans/grants.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
                <h3>What are the issues?</h3>
                <h5>After studying the app and asking 15 users about the issues they have with it, the following problems stood out:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users find the layout and overall visual design of the app outdated and uninviting to use.</li>
                    <li>The users have to navigate back to the home screen few times before viewing all the necessary information they are after.</li>
                    <li>All of the options on the home screen contained in one-sized boxes, even though 2-3 of them are used a lot more than the others.</li>
                    <li>All users preferred using the website because everything they needed was displayed on a single page.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
