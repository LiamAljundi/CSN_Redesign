            <h5>CSN app is issued by the Swedish National Board of Student Aid for students who are receiving
                grants/loans</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Check if a payment back from the student is received, and the remaining unpaid amount.</li>
                <li>Check the date when a student gets paid.</li>
                <li>Hand in study insurances.</li>

            <h3>What are the issues?</h3>
            <h5>After studying the app and asking 15 users about the issues they have with it, the following problems
                stood out:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Users find the layout and overall visual design of the app outdated and uninviting to use.</li>
                <li>The users have to navigate back to the home screen few times before viewing all the
                    necessary information they are after.</li>
                <li>All of the options on the home screen contained in one-sized boxes, even though 2-3 of them are used
                    a lot more than the others.</li>
                <li>All users preferred using the website because everything they needed was displayed on a single page.
                </li>

            <h3>User-testing</h3>
            <h5>The new design of the app was tested with 14 users, and here are the outcomes:</h5>


            <p>The users complemented the new layouts and found them more modern and easier to navigate than the
                original app.
                The users liked the way the necessary information was displayed on the main screen.
                They also preferred logging in to the app as the first step rather than seeing all the options
                displayed.
                From observing the users, I found that some things aren't very clear in the design.
                It wasn't clear that pink box and the yellow box navigate to different screens/popups.
                The design may make this distinguish clearer by not including the pink box inside the yellow one
                entirely, by making the bottom border of the yellow box higher.
                It would be interesting to test different ways of making this distinguish clearer,
                as this way of displaying information was preferable by users,
                and is what makes most of them going through the hardship of using the website instead of the app.</p>
